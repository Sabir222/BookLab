Before starting my programming journey in 2023, one of my first searches was what's the best programming IDE? As you'd expect, pretty much all the videos and articles recommended VSCode. So I went with it. For someone with zero programming experience who had never used an IDE before, why would I try anything else when most people (74% according to Stack Overflow) use and recommend it?

Using VSCode wasn‚Äôt a bad experience, but it wasn‚Äôt great either. It‚Äôs like playing games on a 60Hz monitor. You‚Äôd never know what you‚Äôre missing until you try 144Hz or higher.

Like most programming noobs stuck in tutorial hell on YouTube, I couldn‚Äôt help but notice content creators using a text editor in their terminal while coding or explaining something. I was curious, but I never tried it or even looked into it.

One day, I got bored of my PC and decided to program on my laptop. It‚Äôs a slow machine, and running VSCode was a bit laggy. It wasn‚Äôt a fun experience, especially when I had other apps open like pgAdmin and a browser. So I searched online for a lightweight alternative. That‚Äôs when I discovered and installed Neovim.

My first half hour with Neovim was horrible. As someone who had always relied on a mouse to use the computer and looked at the keyboard while typing, it was hell, frustrating, mind-numbing, and completely unproductive. I couldn‚Äôt understand why anyone would use this instead of a normal editor like VSCode. I convinced myself that maybe they just started with Neovim early on and stuck with it out of habit, like those people who say driving manual is the only real way to drive a car. I closed it and didn‚Äôt open it again.

Days passed, and my laptop‚Äôs poor performance while coding kept bugging me. It was discouraging, and learning Neovim started to feel like the only real solution.

So, back to tutorial hell I went, watching videos and following along for hours, only for the config to keep breaking again and again. And mind you, I couldn‚Äôt fix it or even understand the scary red errors Neovim kept throwing at me. I was just a noob with a little bit of JavaScript knowledge. At that point, I had already invested too much time to quit. My ego wouldn‚Äôt let me anyway. After all, I‚Äôm the "tech guy" in my family, the one they call when the TV switches from HDMI to regular TV mode and no one knows how to fix it.

Then, after days of trying to make a config work, I stumbled on a video titled [The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o) . The guy claimed that all I needed was to copy a command from GitHub and I'd have a working Neovim setup. ‚ÄúPfft, yeah right buddy,‚Äù I said to myself. But I ran the installation script anyway and browsed through the config a little.

The config was written with complete beginners in mind. It explained everything, not in some README file, but right there in the code, under each section. Finally, I started to understand why each part was there. I still didn‚Äôt fully get how it all worked, but at least I wasn‚Äôt lost anymore.

The name of the config was Kickstart, created by TJ DeVries, one of Neovim‚Äôs maintainers and a well-known figure in the Neovim community. And just like its name suggests, it really was a kickstarter. Adding plugins to it was easy.

Finally and For the first time, I was actually enjoying Neovim.
